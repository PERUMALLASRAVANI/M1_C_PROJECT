> Bitwise & Arthimetic Operators:
            The following application will be able to help anyone who are  to analyse and find the various problems when it comes to when it comes to operators in C programming language.
         In the following application it will be able to perform operations between bitwise and arthimetic operations using C programming language.
         When programming in the C language, the arithmetic operators help in performing mathematical functions. Arithmetic Operators in C allows a user to construct various formulas and mathematical equations.
.>>Types of Arithmetic Operators in C:
These are two types of Arithmetic Operators in C.

1.Binary
2.Unary
  Binary:Binary Arithmetic Operators
            This type of operator operates on two of the operands. A typical binary operator appears in this format with its operands:
operand1 operator operand2.
  
  Unary Arithmetic Operators
           This type of operator operates only on one operand. A typical unary operator appears in the following format with its operand:

operator operand
